	//(8 pts) This is the constructor that takes as input x, which is the size of the
	//list you’ll be creating. The constructor then generates x random numbers between 0
	//and 100, and uses the DLL’s methods to insert each random number into the list in
	////order. It then prints out the list both forwards and backwards. Your main should
	//call this constructor with a random number between 10 and 20, and that will pretty
	//much test most of the methods. For testing purposes, you can print out the list
	//forwards and backwards after inserting each new number to make sure everything is
	//working.
